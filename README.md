# Pi-hole Android Private DNS with Docker

I have been using pi-hole for a while now by deploying it on a cloud VM instance. It has been working well for all devices in my home network as I set the my router to use pi-hole as the DNS server but their was an issue as Android phones don't allow to use cutom DNS on mobile data by giving the IP address of the DNS server.
`./setup.sh <your-domain-name> <email> <time zone> <password>`
